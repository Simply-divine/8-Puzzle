# 8-Puzzle

This is a famous sliding puzzle based on [**A*** algorithm]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)). This is a part of Algorithms course by Sedgewick on coursera. This code passes 100/100 tests on submission.

**The problem.**  The  [8-puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle)  is a sliding puzzle  that is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8, plus a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in row-major order, using as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide tiles either horizontally or vertically into the blank square. The following diagram shows a sequence of moves from an  _initial board_  (left) to the  _goal board_  (right).
